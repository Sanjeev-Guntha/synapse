# Frontend (Synapse - Smart Learning Navigator)

This is the frontend application for the Synapse project â€” a smart learning navigator that helps generate flashcards, quizzes and mind maps from documents.

## Getting started (local development)

Prerequisites: Node.js (LTS) and npm installed.

1. Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```sh
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production

```sh
npm run build
```

## Project tech

- Vite
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn-ui (components)

## Notes

- The `package-lock.json` may be regenerated after removing or changing devDependencies.
- If you removed a devDependency, run `npm install` to update the lockfile.

If you need help running the app locally or want me to also regenerate the lockfile and remove installed node modules referencing removed packages, tell me and I can proceed.
